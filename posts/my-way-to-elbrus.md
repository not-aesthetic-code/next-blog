# This is a title

Before I found freeCodeCamp, I was a complete coding novice. As an undergrad, I learned some basic Python and used MATLAB in my mechanical engineering classes, most of which I had forgotten.

Then I discovered freeCodeCamp on Medium. I started with some of the coding challenges, which taught me the basics of how to code with just enough structure that I could complement with my own practice and exploration outside of the curriculum.

Before learning how to code, I also taught myself how to design user interfaces in Sketch, which helped me understand many of the concepts involved in front-end development. As I worked through the challenges, I kept thinking about products I could both design and code.
