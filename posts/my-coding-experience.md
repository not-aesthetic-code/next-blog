# This is a title

Before I found freeCodeCamp, I was a complete coding novice. As an undergrad, I learned some basic Python and used MATLAB in my mechanical engineering classes, most of which I had forgotten.

Then I discovered freeCodeCamp on Medium. I started with some of the coding challenges, which taught me the basics of how to code with just enough structure that I could complement with my own practice and exploration outside of the curriculum.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based Routing
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

## File-based Routing
